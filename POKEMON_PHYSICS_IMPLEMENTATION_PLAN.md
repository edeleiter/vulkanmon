## 🎮 EXAMPLE: How Pokemon Gameplay Uses These Generic Systems

### Pokemon Movement Implementation (Game Layer)
```cpp
// Game-specific Pokemon movement using engine systems
class PokemonMovementSystem : public System {
    void configurePokemon(EntityID entity, PokemonSpecies species) {
        // Use generic CharacterController with Pokemon-specific parameters
        auto& controller = world.addComponent<CharacterControllerComponent>(entity);

        switch(species.movementType) {
            case LAND:
                controller.moveSpeed = species.baseSpeed;
                controller.jumpForce = species.jumpStrength;
                // Uses generic ground detection
                break;
            case FLYING:
                controller.useGravity = false;
                controller.moveSpeed = species.flySpeed;
                // Uses generic gravity zones (zero gravity)
                break;
            case WATER:
                // Uses generic water volume system
                controller.waterMovementMultiplier = 2.0f;
                controller.landMovementMultiplier = 0.5f;
                break;
        }
    }
};
```

### Pokeball Throwing Implementation (Game Layer)
```cpp
// Game-specific Pokeball using generic projectile system
void throwPokeball(glm::vec3 direction, float force) {
    EntityID pokeball = world.createEntity();

    // Use generic ProjectileComponent
    auto& projectile = world.addComponent<ProjectileComponent>(pokeball);
    projectile.velocity = direction * force;
    projectile.bounceCount = 3;
    projectile.lifetime = 10.0f;

    // Use generic collision events
    CollisionEvents::register(pokeball, [](CollisionData data) {
        if (data.otherEntity.hasComponent<PokemonComponent>()) {
            startCaptureSequence(data.otherEntity);
        }
    });
}
```

### Environmental Behavior (Game Layer)
```cpp
// Game-specific terrain preferences using generic systems
class PokemonEnvironmentSystem : public System {
    void update(float deltaTime) {
        // Use generic water detection, surface properties, etc.
        for (auto [entity, pokemon, position] : world.view<Pokemon, Transform>()) {
            if (pokemon.isWaterType && !isInWater(position)) {
                // Water Pokemon on land - apply movement penalty
                auto& controller = world.getComponent<CharacterController>(entity);
                controller.moveSpeedMultiplier = 0.3f; // Slow on land
            }

## 📝 NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Development Philosophy
Follow VulkanMon's core principles throughout:
- **Simple is Powerful**: Elegant solutions over complex ones
- **Test as we go**: Validate each phase before moving to the next
- **Document often**: Keep clear records of design decisions

### Risk Mitigation
- **Prototype each phase** before full implementation
- **Performance test early** - don't wait until the end
- **Keep fallback options** - ensure system degrades gracefully under load

### Success Measurement
Each phase should have **clear, testable success criteria** and **concrete gameplay demonstrations** that prove the system works as intended.
