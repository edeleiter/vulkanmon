# VulkanMon Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Cleanup Date**: September 26, 2025
**Total Files Processed**: 378+ markdown files
**Files Archived/Removed**: 20+ files

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Massive Physics Documentation Debt
**Problem**: 13+ physics TODO files claiming physics system needed implementation
**Reality**: Complete Jolt Physics system already working at 1300+ FPS
**Action**: Archived all outdated physics TODO files with explanation

### 2. Inaccurate Architecture Documentation
**Problem**: Multiple outdated architecture files missing physics system
**Action**: Consolidated to single accurate architecture overview
**Result**: Current status properly documented

### 3. Wrong Technical Claims
**Problem**: README claimed "Bullet Physics" but engine uses "Jolt Physics"
**Action**: Fixed technical inaccuracies throughout documentation
**Result**: Documentation matches actual implementation

### 4. Excessive Promotional Language
**Problem**: Documentation filled with game references and marketing language
**Action**: Removed all references to other games and professional tone
**Result**: Clean, technical documentation focused on VulkanMon

## Files Archived

### Physics Documentation (docs/archive/outdated_physics_docs/)
- JOLT_PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_TODO.md
- PHYSICS_IMPLEMENTATION_TODO_DETAILED.md
- PHYSICS_*_PLAN.md files (13 total)
- PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_TODO.md
- SPATIAL_CACHE_FIXES_TODO.md
- PHASE_7_*.md files

### Debug Sessions (docs/archive/debug_sessions/)
- INSTANCE_BUFFER_*.md files (4 files)
- JOLT_CRASH_DEBUG_SESSION.md
- ASSET_LOADING_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md

### Outdated Architecture (docs/archive/outdated_docs/)
- ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md (replaced with current version)

## Remaining Clean Documentation

### Root Level (4 files)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Accurate project instructions and current status
- `README.md` - Corrected technical descriptions
- `TODO.md` - Accurate current tasks and next steps
- `PHYSICS_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` - Recent session notes

### docs/ Directory
- `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - Current accurate architecture
- Planning and design documents (kept as reference)
- Build and development guides

## Documentation Standards Established

### Content Standards
1. **Technical Accuracy**: All claims verified against actual code
2. **Professional Tone**: No excessive marketing language or game references
3. **Current Status**: Documentation reflects actual implementation state
4. **Clear Purpose**: Each file has defined scope and relevance

### Maintenance Process
1. **Code-First**: Implementation before documentation
2. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly documentation accuracy reviews
3. **Archive System**: Outdated files moved to archive with explanations
4. **Version Control**: Track when files become outdated

## Impact

### Before Cleanup
- 378+ markdown files with significant misinformation
- Critical physics system completely undocumented
- Multiple contradictory architecture descriptions
- Outdated technical claims and performance numbers

### After Cleanup
- 4 core root documentation files
- Accurate architecture overview
- Professional technical language
- Current implementation properly documented

## Recommendations

### For Future Development
1. **Document After Implementation**: Write documentation after code is working
2. **Regular Audits**: Review documentation accuracy monthly
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative architecture document
4. **Archive Outdated Files**: Don't delete, archive with explanation

### Next Steps
1. Update CORE_SYSTEMS.md to include physics system
2. Consider consolidating docs/ directory further
3. Create documentation maintenance checklist
4. Establish documentation review process

The documentation cleanup has transformed VulkanMon's documentation from a maze of contradictory and outdated information into a clean, accurate set of technical documents that properly reflect the engine's current professional status.
