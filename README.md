## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 11+, MSVC 2019+)
- Vulkan SDK 1.3+
- CMake 3.20+
- Python 3.8+ (for scripting)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulkanmon.git
cd vulkanmon

# Build the project (dependencies managed by vcpkg)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .

# Run the hello triangle demo

# Run the C++ unit test suite
cd build/tests_cpp
Debug/vulkanmon_tests.exe
```

## Development Philosophy

VulkanMon follows three core tenants:

### ðŸŽ¯ **"Simple is Powerful"**
We favor clear, straightforward solutions over complex ones. Code should be easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

### ðŸ§ª **"Test, Test, Test"**  
Confidence comes from thorough testing at every level - from unit tests to visual validation on real hardware. We have comprehensive C++ unit tests covering all core engine systems!

### ðŸ“š **"Document Often"**
Good documentation is as important as good code. We document the "why" not just the "what".
