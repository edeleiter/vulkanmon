# VulkanMon - Open Source Creature Collector Game Engine

An open-source game engine built with modern C++20 and Vulkan, designed to create a Pokemon-style 3rd person creature collector game with Python scripting capabilities.

## Project Vision

VulkanMon aims to be a high-performance, cross-platform game engine that combines the power of low-level graphics programming with the accessibility of Python scripting. The engine targets developers who want to create creature collection games with modern graphics and flexible gameplay systems.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Engine (C++20)
- **Vulkan Renderer**: Low-level graphics API for maximum performance
- **Physics Integration**: Bullet Physics for realistic interactions
- **Audio System**: OpenAL for 3D positioned audio
- **Resource Management**: Efficient asset loading, caching, and streaming
- **Memory Management**: RAII-based with smart pointers
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, Linux, macOS

### Scripting Layer (Cython)
- **Game Logic**: Creature behaviors, battle mechanics, AI decision trees
- **Data Management**: Stats, abilities, progression systems
- **UI Systems**: Menu logic, inventory management
- **Modding Support**: Easy content creation for community

## Key Features

### Rendering System
- **Modern Vulkan Pipeline**: Physically-based rendering (PBR)
- **Animation System**: Skeletal animation with blending
- **Instanced Rendering**: Efficient rendering of multiple creatures
- **Level-of-Detail (LOD)**: Performance optimization for distant objects
- **Material System**: Flexible shader-based materials

### Game Systems
- **Entity-Component System**: Flexible game object architecture
- **Battle System**: Turn-based combat with abilities and stats
- **Creature Management**: Catching, training, and evolving creatures
- **Save System**: Persistent game state and player progress
- **World Management**: Dynamic loading of game areas

### Developer Tools
- **Asset Pipeline**: Automated processing of 3D models, textures, audio
- **Debug UI**: Dear ImGui integration for development tools
- **Hot Reloading**: Runtime script updates during development
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in timing and memory analysis

## Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Graphics**: Vulkan SDK, GLFW (windowing), GLM (math)
- **3D Models**: Assimp for model loading and processing
- **Physics**: Bullet Physics for collision and dynamics
- **Audio**: OpenAL Soft for 3D audio processing
- **Build System**: CMake with vcpkg/Conan for dependency management

### Development Tools
- **Languages**: C++20 (core), Cython (scripting interface), Python (game logic)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Documentation**: Doxygen for code documentation
- **Testing**: Modern pytest framework with 14 comprehensive tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 11+, MSVC 2019+)
- Vulkan SDK 1.3+
- CMake 3.20+
- Python 3.8+ (for scripting)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulkanmon.git
cd vulkanmon

# Build the project (dependencies managed by vcpkg)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .

# Run the hello triangle demo
Debug/vulkanmon.exe

# Run the test suite
cd ../tests
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

## Development Philosophy

VulkanMon follows three core tenants:

### ðŸŽ¯ **"Simple is Powerful"**
We favor clear, straightforward solutions over complex ones. Code should be easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

### ðŸ§ª **"Test, Test, Test"**  
Confidence comes from thorough testing at every level - from unit tests to visual validation on real hardware. We now have 14 comprehensive tests covering build, runtime, and integration!

### ðŸ“š **"Document Often"**
Good documentation is as important as good code. We document the "why" not just the "what".
