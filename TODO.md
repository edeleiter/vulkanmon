- [x] 15. Add vertex buffer for triangle data
- [x] 16. Implement basic memory management and cleanup

### Testing Framework
- [x] 17. Modern pytest-based testing framework with 14 comprehensive tests
- [x] 18. Build system validation (CMake configure, build, executable)
- [x] 19. File structure and dependency validation
- [x] 20. Vulkan runtime and integration testing
- [x] 21. Performance and incremental build testing

- [ ] 27. Add model-view-projection matrices

## Phase 3: Core Engine Systems (Steps 28-37)

### Engine Architecture
- [ ] 28. Create resource management system
- [ ] 29. Implement basic logging system
- [ ] 30. Add asset loading pipeline (textures, models)
- [ ] 31. Integrate Assimp for 3D model loading
- [ ] 32. Implement scene management system

### Advanced Rendering
- [ ] 33. Add basic lighting (directional light)
- [ ] 34. Implement PBR material system
- [ ] 35. Add skeletal animation system
- [ ] 36. Implement instanced rendering
- [ ] 37. Add Level-of-Detail (LOD) system

## Phase 4: External Systems Integration (Steps 38-41)

### Physics and Audio
- [ ] 38. Integrate physics engine (Bullet Physics)
- [ ] 39. Add audio system (OpenAL)

### Scripting Layer
- [ ] 40. Set up Cython build system
- [ ] 41. Create C++ to Python interface layer

## Phase 5: Game Framework (Steps 42-44)

### Core Game Systems
- [ ] 42. Implement basic game object/entity system
- [ ] 43. Add input handling system
- [ ] 44. Create third-person camera controller

## Phase 6: Creature Collector Game Logic (Steps 45-54)

### Creature Systems
- [ ] 45. Implement creature data structures
- [ ] 46. Add creature spawning and management
- [ ] 47. Create battle system framework
- [ ] 48. Implement creature stats and abilities

### Persistence and UI
- [ ] 49. Add save/load system for game state
- [ ] 50. Create basic UI system
- [ ] 51. Implement inventory and item system
- [ ] 52. Add world/level loading system

### Advanced Game Features
- [ ] 53. Create creature AI behavior trees
- [ ] 54. Implement multiplayer networking foundation

## Current Status

**ðŸŽ‰ HELLO TRIANGLE COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰** ALL Steps 1-16 DONE!
**Achievement Unlocked**: Beautiful RGB gradient triangle rendering!

### Progress Summary
âœ… **Phase 1 COMPLETE (Steps 1-16)**: Vulkan Hello Triangle fully implemented with vertex buffers!
ðŸŽŠ **Result**: Real-time triangle rendering with proper synchronization
ðŸš€ **Next**: Ready for Phase 2 - 3D Graphics Foundation!

## Notes

- Each step builds upon the previous ones
- Focus on getting each step working before moving to the next
- Test frequently and commit working changes
- The Hello Triangle (steps 4-16) is the most critical foundation
- Cython integration (steps 35-36) bridges C++ engine to Python game logic
- Game-specific features (steps 40+) implement the Pokemon-like gameplay

## Development Principles

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the simplest possible implementation
2. **Iterative Development**: Get something working, then improve it
3. **Test Early**: Validate each system as it's built
4. **Document Progress**: Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
5. **Modular Design**: Build systems that can be extended and modified
