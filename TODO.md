# VulkanMon Development Roadmap

A comprehensive step-by-step plan from Vulkan Hello Triangle to Pokemon-like creature collector game.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Hello Triangle (Steps 1-16)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] 1. Set up Vulkan SDK and development environment
- [ ] 2. Install dependencies (GLFW, GLM, vcpkg/Conan)
- [ ] 3. Create basic CMake project structure

### Hello Triangle Core
- [ ] 4. Initialize Vulkan instance and debug layers
- [ ] 5. Create window surface with GLFW
- [ ] 6. Select physical device and create logical device
- [ ] 7. Create swap chain and image views
- [ ] 8. Create render pass
- [ ] 9. Load and compile triangle vertex/fragment shaders
- [ ] 10. Create graphics pipeline
- [ ] 11. Create framebuffers
- [ ] 12. Create command pool and command buffers
- [ ] 13. Record drawing commands
- [ ] 14. Implement main render loop with synchronization
- [ ] 15. Add vertex buffer for triangle data
- [ ] 16. Implement basic memory management and cleanup

## Phase 2: 3D Graphics Foundation (Steps 17-22)

### Textures and 3D
- [ ] 17. Add texture loading and sampling
- [ ] 18. Implement uniform buffer objects (UBOs)
- [ ] 19. Add depth testing and depth buffer
- [ ] 20. Load and render 3D models (start with simple cube)
- [ ] 21. Implement basic camera system
- [ ] 22. Add model-view-projection matrices

## Phase 3: Core Engine Systems (Steps 23-32)

### Engine Architecture
- [ ] 23. Create resource management system
- [ ] 24. Implement basic logging system
- [ ] 25. Add asset loading pipeline (textures, models)
- [ ] 26. Integrate Assimp for 3D model loading
- [ ] 27. Implement scene management system

### Advanced Rendering
- [ ] 28. Add basic lighting (directional light)
- [ ] 29. Implement PBR material system
- [ ] 30. Add skeletal animation system
- [ ] 31. Implement instanced rendering
- [ ] 32. Add Level-of-Detail (LOD) system

## Phase 4: External Systems Integration (Steps 33-36)

### Physics and Audio
- [ ] 33. Integrate physics engine (Bullet Physics)
- [ ] 34. Add audio system (OpenAL)

### Scripting Layer
- [ ] 35. Set up Cython build system
- [ ] 36. Create C++ to Python interface layer

## Phase 5: Game Framework (Steps 37-39)

### Core Game Systems
- [ ] 37. Implement basic game object/entity system
- [ ] 38. Add input handling system
- [ ] 39. Create third-person camera controller

## Phase 6: Creature Collector Game Logic (Steps 40-49)

### Creature Systems
- [ ] 40. Implement creature data structures
- [ ] 41. Add creature spawning and management
- [ ] 42. Create battle system framework
- [ ] 43. Implement creature stats and abilities

### Persistence and UI
- [ ] 44. Add save/load system for game state
- [ ] 45. Create basic UI system
- [ ] 46. Implement inventory and item system
- [ ] 47. Add world/level loading system

### Advanced Game Features
- [ ] 48. Create creature AI behavior trees
- [ ] 49. Implement multiplayer networking foundation

## Current Status

**Next Step**: Start with Step 1 - Set up Vulkan SDK and development environment

## Notes

- Each step builds upon the previous ones
- Focus on getting each step working before moving to the next
- Test frequently and commit working changes
- The Hello Triangle (steps 4-16) is the most critical foundation
- Cython integration (steps 35-36) bridges C++ engine to Python game logic
- Game-specific features (steps 40+) implement the Pokemon-like gameplay

## Development Principles

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the simplest possible implementation
2. **Iterative Development**: Get something working, then improve it
3. **Test Early**: Validate each system as it's built
4. **Document Progress**: Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
5. **Modular Design**: Build systems that can be extended and modified
