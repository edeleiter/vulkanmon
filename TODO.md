# VulkanMon - Current Tasks

## Next Development Priorities

### Phase 7: Python Integration üêç
- [ ] **Embedded Python Scripting** - Game logic and creature AI in Python
- [ ] **Cython Performance Extensions** - High-performance battle calculations
- [ ] **Hot-reload Development** - Iterate on gameplay without C++ compilation

### Pokemon Gameplay Systems
- [ ] **Creature Movement AI** - Pokemon movement patterns and behavior
- [ ] **Battle System Foundation** - Turn-based battle mechanics
- [ ] **World Generation** - Pokemon world terrain and environment systems
- [ ] **Player Controller** - Advanced player movement and interaction

### Performance & Polish
- [ ] **GPU Instancing** - Efficient rendering for massive creature counts
- [ ] **LOD System** - Level-of-detail for performance scaling
- [ ] **Async Asset Loading** - Background asset streaming

## Current Technical Status ‚úÖ

All core engine systems are **production ready**:
- ‚úÖ **ECS Architecture** - Multi-object rendering with spatial systems
- ‚úÖ **Vulkan Renderer** - Professional graphics pipeline with RAII memory management
- ‚úÖ **Debug Tooling** - Unity/Unreal-style ECS Inspector
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework** - 111 test cases, 1769 assertions, 100% pass rate
- ‚úÖ **Build System** - Cross-platform with vcpkg dependency management
- ‚úÖ **Spatial Systems** - Octree-based creature detection for Pokemon gameplay
