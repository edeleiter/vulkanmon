# VulkanMon - Development Status

## üéâ HELLO TRIANGLE MILESTONE COMPLETE! üéâ

**Status**: ALL CORE STEPS COMPLETE! Beautiful RGB triangle rendering successfully!

### ‚úÖ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Perfect Triangle Rendering!

**What You Now See:**
- **Beautiful RGB gradient triangle** with real-time rendering
- **Red vertex** at the top
- **Blue vertex** at bottom-right
- **Green vertex** at bottom-left  
- **Smooth color interpolation** between all vertices

### Ready for Phase 2: 3D Graphics Foundation
The next development branch should focus on 3D models, textures, and camera systems!

## Current Working System Status ‚úÖ

**Console Output (All Working):**
```
Vulkan instance created successfully!
Window surface created successfully!
Selected GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
Logical device created successfully!
Swap chain created successfully with 3 images!
Render pass created successfully!
Shaders loaded successfully!
Graphics pipeline created successfully!
Framebuffers created successfully!
Command pool created successfully!
Command buffers allocated successfully!
Drawing commands recorded successfully! ‚Üê CURRENT STATE
```

## Files Status:

### Source Files:
- `src/main.cpp` - Main application (13 steps complete, needs render loop)
- `shaders/triangle.vert` - Vertex shader (RGB triangle, hardcoded vertices)
- `shaders/triangle_frag.spv` - Compiled fragment shader
- `shaders/triangle_vert.spv` - Compiled vertex shader

### Build Commands:
```bash
cd build
cmake --build .
Debug/vulkanmon.exe
```

### Current Architecture:
- **Instance**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Surface**: ‚úÖ Connected to GLFW window  
- **Device**: ‚úÖ RTX 5070 Ti selected
- **Swap Chain**: ‚úÖ 3 images, V-Sync
- **Render Pass**: ‚úÖ Clear to black, render triangle
- **Shaders**: ‚úÖ Compiled SPIR-V loaded
- **Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Complete graphics pipeline
- **Framebuffers**: ‚úÖ Connected to swap chain
- **Commands**: ‚úÖ Triangle drawing recorded
- **Missing**: Render loop execution ‚Üê ONLY THIS LEFT!

## The Triangle:
- **Vertices**: Hardcoded in vertex shader (no vertex buffer needed)
- **Colors**: Red (top), Green (bottom-left), Blue (bottom-right)
- **Position**: Centered in screen
- **Expected Result**: Beautiful RGB gradient triangle

## Key Implementation Notes:
- Keep it SIMPLE - no complex features yet
- Everything is working - just need the render loop
- All cleanup is implemented
- No validation errors in current build

**CRITICAL**: After Step 14, you should immediately see the triangle render!
