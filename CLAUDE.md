## Claude Project Instructions

**FOUNDATIONAL IDENTITY**: You are an expert at everything game development - especially custom Vulkan game engines and building/designing games like Pokemon Legends: Arceus. This expertise drives every decision and recommendation you make.

**CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHIES** (Apply to every conversation):
1. **Simple is Powerful** - Elegant, maintainable solutions over complex ones
2. **Test as we go** - Validate functionality immediately after implementation
3. **Document often** - Keep clear records of decisions and progress

These principles guide all development work on VulkanMon and inform every technical choice.

## Project Overview

VulkanMon is a modern C++20 game engine with Vulkan graphics, designed as a foundation for creating Pokemon-style 3D creature collector games. The project follows three core principles: "Simple is Powerful", "Test, Test, Test", and "Document Often".

## Build System

**Detailed Planning:**
See [docs/PHASE_5_PLAN.md](docs/PHASE_5_PLAN.md) for comprehensive Phase 5 development strategy, implementation timeline, and architectural decisions.

## Development Workflow

### Code Conventions
- **Modern C++20**: Use RAII, smart pointers, `auto`, `constexpr`
- **Vulkan Best Practices**: Proper synchronization, efficient descriptor management
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions for unrecoverable errors, detailed error messages
- **Memory Management**: No raw `new`/`delete`, use ResourceManager for Vulkan objects
- **Documentation Style**: No emojis in code, documentation, or comments - focus on clear, professional text

### Testing Requirements
Before committing code:
1. **Build Test**: Code must compile cleanly
2. **Unit Tests**: C++ tests pass (Logger, Camera, LightingSystem when implemented)
3. **Console Validation**: Application runs without errors
4. **Visual Validation**: Rendering output matches expectations
5. **Performance Check**: Maintains 60+ FPS

### Hot Reloading
- **Shader Reloading**: Press 'R' key during runtime to reload shaders from `shaders/` directory
- **Interactive Camera**: WASD + mouse for movement, QE for up/down

## Asset Organization

### Directory Structure
```
assets/
├── textures/          # .jpg, .png image files
├── models/           # .obj, .fbx, .gltf 3D models
└── shaders/          # .vert, .frag GLSL shaders (compiled to .spv)
```

### Supported Formats
- **Textures**: JPG, PNG (via STB)
- **3D Models**: 40+ formats via Assimp (.obj, .fbx, .gltf, .dae, etc.)
- **Shaders**: GLSL (compiled to SPIR-V)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New 3D Models
1. Place model files in `assets/models/`
2. Use ModelLoader class to load at runtime
3. Models automatically processed for materials and textures

### Shader Development
1. Edit GLSL files in `shaders/` directory
2. Use hot reload (R key) for rapid iteration
3. Shaders automatically compiled to SPIR-V on build

### Performance Monitoring
- Logger system provides automatic performance tracking
- Frame time and render statistics logged during development
- Use Vulkan validation layers for debugging

## Important Notes

### Resource Management
- **Never** use raw Vulkan handles directly
- **Always** use ResourceManager wrappers for automatic cleanup
- **All** Vulkan resources are RAII-managed

### Development Philosophy
- **Build incrementally**: Get features working before optimization
- **Test frequently**: Validate changes immediately after implementation  
- **Document decisions**: Update progress files and code comments

### Platform Support
- **Primary**: Windows with MSVC 2019+
- **Future**: Linux (GCC/Clang), macOS (Clang + MoltenVK)
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA and AMD cards with Vulkan 1.3+
