## ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Build Incrementally** - Each day builds on previous work
2. **Test Early and Often** - Performance validation at each step
3. **Profile Continuously** - Identify bottlenecks before they become problems
4. **Document as You Go** - Knowledge capture for future development

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Fallbacks** - Graceful degradation if targets not met
- **Modular Design** - Systems can be disabled/swapped independently
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Automated benchmarks prevent regressions
- **Professional Standards** - Code quality suitable for production release

### Success Metrics Tracking
- **Daily Performance Reports** - FPS, memory, render statistics
- **Weekly Milestone Reviews** - Feature completeness and quality assessment
- **Continuous Integration** - All tests passing, no regressions
- **End-to-End Validation** - Complete Pokemon-style creature experience
