# VulkanMon Development Philosophy

## Core Tenants

### **"Simple is Powerful"**
- **Principle**: Favor clear, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Application**: 
  - Write code that's easy to understand and maintain
  - Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
  - Choose established patterns over clever tricks
  - Build incrementally - get something working first, then improve
- **Examples**: 
  - Our triangle uses hardcoded vertices before vertex buffers
  - Clear function names like `createRenderPass()` vs `initRP()`
  - One responsibility per function

### **"Test, Test, Test"**
- **Principle**: Confidence comes from thorough testing at every level
- **Application**:
  - Test each component as it's built
  - Build and run frequently during development
  - Validate with real hardware and different configurations
  - Create automated tests for critical paths
  - Manual testing for visual and user experience validation
- **Examples**:
  - Console output validation at each step
  - Visual confirmation of triangle rendering
  - Cross-platform build testing
  - Performance profiling on target hardware

### **"Document Often"**
- **Principle**: Good documentation is as important as good code
- **Application**:
  - Document the "why" not just the "what"
  - Keep documentation up to date with code changes
  - Write for future developers (including future you)
  - Include examples and usage patterns
  - Document known issues and workarounds
- **Examples**:
  - Detailed README with project vision
  - Step-by-step progress tracking
  - Code comments explaining complex Vulkan concepts
  - Build instructions that actually work

## Development Practices

### **Iterative Development**
1. **Get it working** - Focus on functionality first
2. **Make it right** - Refactor for clarity and correctness  
3. **Make it fast** - Optimize when and where needed
4. **Make it beautiful** - Polish the user experience

### **Quality Gates**
- **Before each commit**: Code builds cleanly
- **Before each push**: All tests pass
- **Before each merge**: Documentation is updated
- **Before each release**: Cross-platform validation

### **Game Development Specific**
- **Performance matters**: Target 60 FPS minimum
- **Memory management**: No leaks, efficient allocation
- **Cross-platform first**: Write portable code from day one
- **Modding friendly**: Design for extensibility
- **Artist friendly**: Tools should be intuitive

## Code Standards

### **Modern C++**
- Use C++20 features appropriately
- RAII for all resource management
- Smart pointers over raw pointers
- Prefer `auto` when type is obvious
- Use `constexpr` when possible

### **Vulkan Best Practices**
- Proper synchronization everywhere
- Efficient descriptor management
- Minimal state changes
- Batch similar operations
- Profile on target hardware

### **Error Handling**
- Exceptions for unrecoverable errors
- Return codes for expected failures
- Detailed error messages with context
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second total)
- Run on every build

### **Integration Tests**
- Test component interactions
- Real Vulkan API calls
- Validate rendering output
- Run before commits

### **Performance Tests**
- Frame rate validation
- Memory usage tracking
- Load testing with multiple creatures
- Run before releases

### **Manual Testing**
- Visual validation
- User experience testing
- Cross-platform verification
- Edge case exploration

## Documentation Standards

### **Code Comments**
- Explain the "why" behind complex logic
- Document assumptions and preconditions
- Include usage examples for public APIs
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

### **Architecture Documentation**
- High-level system overviews
- Component interaction diagrams  
- Data flow documentation
- Extension points and customization

### **User Documentation**
- Clear build instructions
- Getting started tutorials
- API reference with examples
- Troubleshooting guides

*"The best code is not just working code, but code that can be easily understood, modified, and extended by others."*

*These principles guide every decision in VulkanMon development, from the smallest function to the largest architectural choice.*
