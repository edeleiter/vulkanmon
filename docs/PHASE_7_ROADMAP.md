# Phase 7 Roadmap: Pokemon Legends Arceus Foundation

## Overview
This roadmap transforms VulkanMon from a tech demo into a Pokemon-ready game engine with the four critical missing systems: Physics, Terrain, Audio, and Animation.

## Phase 7.1: Physics/Collision System (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Enable realistic Pokemon movement and Pokeball mechanics
**Status**: In Progress - see main todo list

### Critical Deliverables:
- Ground collision for all entities
- Terrain mesh collision detection
- Projectile physics for Pokeball throwing
- Spatial-physics integration for performance
- Gravity and realistic movement

### Success Criteria:
- Creatures cannot pass through terrain or obstacles
- Player can throw Pokeballs with realistic physics
- All movement respects collision boundaries
- Physics runs at 60+ FPS with hundreds of entities

## Phase 7.2: Terrain Generation System
**Goal**: Create vast Pokemon world environments
**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (needs collision system)

### Key Features:
- Heightmap-based terrain rendering
- Biome system (grass fields, forests, water, mountains)
- Environmental object placement (trees, rocks, buildings)
- Level design pipeline for designers

## Phase 7.3: Audio System
**Goal**: Bring Pokemon world to life with sound
**Dependencies**: None (can run parallel with terrain)

### Key Features:
- 3D positional audio for creature cries
- Biome-specific ambient soundscapes
- Dynamic music system
- Sound effect integration with ECS events

## Phase 7.4: Animation System
**Goal**: Make creatures feel alive and reactive
**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (needs physics for realistic movement)

### Key Features:
- Skeletal animation with bone hierarchies
- Animation state machine tied to CreatureComponent states
- Blend trees for smooth transitions
- Combat and interaction animations

## Implementation Strategy
Each phase builds on previous foundations:
1. Physics enables realistic movement
2. Terrain provides world to explore
3. Audio creates immersion
4. Animation brings creatures to life

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 7.1 (Physics): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 7.2 (Terrain): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 7.3 (Audio): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 7.4 (Animation): 3-4 weeks

**Total**: 8-12 weeks to Pokemon-ready engine
