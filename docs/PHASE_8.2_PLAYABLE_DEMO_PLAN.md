# Phase 8.2: First Playable Pokemon Demo - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Mission Statement

**Transform VulkanMon from a feature-complete engine into a playable Pokemon-style game demo.**

Implement the minimal viable gameplay loop: Walk around ‚Üí See creatures ‚Üí Throw pokeball ‚Üí Capture creature ‚Üí View party.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy: Engine vs Game Separation

### **Engine Layer** (`src/` directory)
- Generic, reusable systems
- No Pokemon-specific logic
- Can be used for any game
- Example: `CharacterControllerComponent`, `AIBehaviorComponent`, `CaptureSystem`

### **Game Layer** (`game/` directory)
- Pokemon-specific gameplay logic
- Uses engine components
- Game rules and mechanics
- Example: `PokemonCreatureData`, `PokemonCaptureLogic`, `PokemonPartyManager`

### **Directory Structure**
```
src/
  components/           # Engine components (generic)
    CharacterControllerComponent.h
    AIBehaviorComponent.h
    CreatureStatsComponent.h
  systems/              # Engine systems (generic)
    CharacterControllerSystem.h
    AIBehaviorSystem.h
    CaptureSystem.h
