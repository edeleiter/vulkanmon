# Part 4: Development Timeline, Resources & Implementation Strategy

## Development Timeline Integration

### Phase 1 Addition: Dual Renderer Foundation (Months 6-8)
```yaml
Core MVP Extensions:
Base Tasks: Engine foundation, basic rendering, creature system
Additional Dual Renderer Tasks:
- [ ] Abstract scene representation system
- [ ] Basic 2D sprite renderer with pixel-perfect upscaling
- [ ] Simple tilemap system (8x8 tiles)
- [ ] Cross-era asset loading framework
- [ ] Basic transition system (simple fade)
- [ ] Era-specific input handling

Additional Effort: +2 months
Additional Cost: +$80k
Team Extensions:
- 2D Pixel Artist (Contract): $60/hour, ~3 months = $28k
- Retro Game Design Consultant: $1,000/week for 4 weeks = $4k

Success Criteria:
- Can switch between 3D and 2D rendering modes
- Same creature appears correctly in both modes
- Basic pixel-perfect 2D rendering at 240x160 → scaled to screen
- Simple transition effect works
```

### Phase 2 Addition: Era-Specific Gameplay (Months 18-22)
```yaml
Enhanced Rendering Extensions:
Base Tasks: Deferred rendering, PBR materials, advanced lighting
Additional Dual Systems:
- [ ] Advanced sprite animation system with frame-perfect timing
- [ ] GBA-style palette system (16 palettes × 16 colors)
- [ ] Cross-era animation synchronization
- [ ] Era-specific gameplay rule engine
- [ ] Advanced tilemap rendering with layers
- [ ] 2D collision system for pixel-perfect movement

Additional Effort: +4 months  
Additional Cost: +$150k
Team Extensions:
- Full-time 2D Artist: $75k/year
- Gameplay Systems Programmer: $110k/year
- Additional 3D Artists for dual asset creation: $70k/year

Asset Creation Pipeline:
Per Creature Dual Assets:
- Modern Era (3D): 2-3 days modeling + 2 days animation = $2,000
- Classic Era (2D): 1 day sprite art + 1 day animation = $400  
- Total per creature: $2,400
- For 50 creatures (MVP): $120k in art assets
```

### Phase 3 Addition: Advanced Transitions (Months 30-34)
```yaml
Advanced Graphics Extensions:
Base Tasks: Advanced post-processing, SSR, temporal
