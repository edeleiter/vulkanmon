   - Documentation is present and meaningful

### **The Spatial System Progress**

Based on our previous conversations, you've been building a spatial hash grid system for efficient creature spawning and queries. This is THE critical system for a Pokemon Legends: Arceus style game.

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **1. Complete & Test Spatial System Integration**
```cpp
// Ensure these are working:
- SpatialHashGrid radius queries for creature detection
- Efficient moving entity updates
- Layer-based filtering (ground creatures vs flying)
- Spatial component integration with ECS
```

**Tests to add:**
- Stress test with 1000+ entities
- Moving entity cell updates
- Boundary crossing scenarios
- Query performance benchmarks

### **2. Basic Terrain System**
Since you have spatial partitioning, you need something to partition:

```cpp
class TerrainSystem {
    // Simple heightmap-based terrain
    float getHeightAtPosition(vec2 xz);
    TerrainType getTerrainType(vec3 pos); // Grass, Water, Rock
    
    // Integration with spatial system
    void registerWithSpatialSystem();
};
```

Start simple - even a flat plane with different texture regions. The spatial system can use terrain types for spawn rules.

### **3. Creature Component & Basic AI**

```cpp
// Components to add:
struct CreatureComponent {
    uint32_t species_id;
    uint32_t level;
    CreatureState state; // Idle, Roaming, Alert, Fleeing
    float awareness_radius;
};

struct AIComponent {
    BehaviorTree* behavior;
    float decision_timer;
    EntityId target;
};

// Basic behavior system
class CreatureBehaviorSystem : public System {
    void update(float dt) {
        // Use spatial system for awareness checks
        // Simple state machine for now
    }
};
```

### **4. Player Interaction System**

```cpp
class InteractionSystem {
    // Pokeball throwing (uses spatial raycast)
    void throwPokeball(vec3 origin, vec3 direction);
    
    // Creature detection UI
    std::vector<EntityId> getNearbyCreatures(vec3 pos, float radius);
    
    // Stealth mechanics
    bool isPlayerDetected(EntityId creature, EntityId player);
};
```

### **5. Spawn System**

```cpp
class SpawnSystem {
    struct SpawnPoint {
        vec3 position;
        float radius;
        std::vector<CreatureSpawnData> possible_spawns;
        float spawn_timer;
    };
    
    void update(float dt) {
        // Use spatial system to check spawn point occupancy
        // Spawn creatures based on time of day, weather, etc.
    }
};
```

## 📋 **The Path to Pokemon Legends: Arceus**

### **Phase 1: Core Systems** (You're here)
- ✅ Rendering, ECS, Materials
- 🔄 Spatial system (in progress)
- ⬜ Basic terrain
- ⬜ Simple creature AI

### **Phase 2: Gameplay Loop**
- ⬜ Catching mechanics
- ⬜ Basic battle system
- ⬜ Inventory/Pokedex
- ⬜ Save/Load

### **Phase 3: Open World**
- ⬜ Terrain streaming
- ⬜ LOD system
- ⬜ Weather system
- ⬜ Day/night cycle

### **Phase 4: Polish**
- ⬜ Animation system
- ⬜ Particle effects
- ⬜ Audio integration
- ⬜ UI polish

## 🎯 **This Week's Goals**

1. **Finish spatial system tests** - Get to 100% coverage like your other systems
2. **Add a simple terrain plane** - Even if it's just a large textured quad
3. **Implement one creature with basic roaming AI** - Use the spatial system for obstacle avoidance
4. **Add debug visualization** - Draw spatial grid cells in ImGui for debugging

## 💡 **Architecture Recommendations**

### **1. Keep Systems Decoupled**
Your ECS is clean - resist the urge to create dependencies between systems

### **2. Profile Early**
With spatial queries being so critical, add timing metrics now:
```cpp
class SpatialSystem {
    struct Stats {
        float last_update_ms;
        uint32_t query_count;
        uint32_t entity_moves;
    };
};
```

### **3. Document Spawning Rules**
Create a simple JSON/YAML format for creature spawn configurations early:
```yaml
spawn_points:
  - location: "grassland_01"
    creatures:
      - species: "pikachu"
        level_range: [5, 10]
        spawn_rate: 0.3
        time_of_day: "morning"
```

### **4. Test with Scale**
Always test with 100+ creatures even if they're just spheres - Pokemon games need density

## 🔧 **Technical Priorities**

### **Immediate (This Sprint)**
1. Complete spatial system with tests
2. Basic terrain plane
3. One roaming creature
4. Debug visualization

### **Next Sprint**
1. Pokeball throwing mechanics
2. Creature catching state machine
3. Basic inventory system
4. Spawn point system

### **Following Sprint**
1. Battle system prototype
2. Creature stats/leveling
3. Save/load system
4. Basic UI for inventory/Pokedex

## 📊 **Performance Targets**

- **Spatial queries**: < 0.1ms for 100 entity radius query
- **Creature AI**: < 5ms for 100 active creatures
- **Rendering**: Maintain 60 FPS with 200+ entities
- **Memory**: < 100MB for spatial system with 10,000 entities

## 🎨 **Debug Visualization Checklist**

- [ ] Spatial grid cell boundaries
- [ ] Entity bounding boxes
- [ ] Query radius visualization
- [ ] Creature AI state indicators
- [ ] Spawn point zones
- [ ] Performance graphs in ImGui

## 📝 **Code Quality Checklist**

- [ ] Spatial system at 100% test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for all queries
- [ ] Documentation for spawn configuration
- [ ] Thread-safe spatial updates
- [ ] Memory pool for spatial queries

## 🚦 **Success Metrics**

You'll know you're ready for the next phase when:
1. You can spawn 100+ creatures that roam naturally
2. Spatial queries complete in < 1ms
3. Players can throw pokeballs and hit creatures
4. The debug UI shows all spatial operations
5. Tests pass for all edge cases

Your engine has an incredibly solid foundation. The spatial system is the right next step, and you're building it the right way. The key now is to get a basic gameplay loop running - even if rough - so you can iterate on what makes Pokemon-style games fun: the discovery and capture of creatures in a living world.
