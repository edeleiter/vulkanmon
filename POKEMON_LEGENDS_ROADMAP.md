# Pokemon Legends Arceus - VulkanMon Development Roadmap

## Ultimate Goal
Create a Pokemon Legends Arceus-style 3D creature collector game using our custom Vulkan engine.

## Current Status: Phase 5.2
âœ… **Foundation Complete**: Vulkan renderer, materials, lighting, camera, asset loading
ðŸš§ **In Progress**: Architecture refactoring (extract classes from main.cpp)

---

## PHASE 6: Core Engine Systems (Foundation for Gameplay)

### 6.1 Entity Component System (ECS)
**Why First**: Everything in Pokemon games is an entity (creatures, NPCs, items, environment)
- Entity Manager with unique IDs
- Component system (Transform, Renderable, Collider, etc.)
- System manager for update loops
- Memory-efficient component storage

### 6.2 Scene Management & Spatial Systems
**Why Critical**: Open world requires efficient object management
- Scene graph with hierarchical transforms
- Spatial partitioning (octree/quadtree) for culling
- Level-of-detail (LOD) system
- Multi-object rendering pipeline

### 6.3 Animation System
**Why Essential**: Creatures need skeletal animation, environment needs movement
- Skeletal animation with bone hierarchies
- Animation blending and state machines
- Morph targets for facial expressions
- Procedural animation support

### 6.4 Physics Integration
**Why Needed**: Collision detection, throwing mechanics, terrain interaction
- Collision detection system
- Rigid body dynamics
- Terrain collision
- Projectile physics (Pokeball throwing)

---

## PHASE 7: Advanced Engine Features

### 7.1 Multi-threading & Performance
- Job system for parallel processing
- Multi-threaded rendering
- Asset streaming system
- Memory pool management

### 7.2 Audio System
- 3D positional audio
- Music and sound effect management
- Audio streaming for large files
- Dynamic audio mixing

### 7.3 UI System
- Immediate mode GUI for debugging
- Game UI system (menus, HUD)
- Text rendering system
- Input handling integration

---

## PHASE 8: Pokemon-Specific Systems

### 8.1 Creature System Foundation
- Creature data structures (stats, types, moves)
- Creature state machines (idle, walking, battling)
- Creature AI behavior trees
- Creature rendering with LOD

### 8.2 World Systems
- Terrain generation and rendering
- Vegetation system (grass, trees)
- Weather system (rain, snow, day/night)
- Biome management

### 8.3 Gameplay Mechanics Core
- Player movement and controls
- Camera system (third-person, lock-on)
- Inventory system
- Save/load system

---

## PHASE 9: Pokemon Legends Arceus Features

### 9.1 Open World Systems
- Large seamless world streaming
- Alpha Pokemon encounters
- Resource gathering mechanics
- Camp/base building

### 9.2 Creature Interaction
- Stealth mechanics
- Pokeball throwing physics
- Creature capture system
- Mount/ride system

### 9.3 Battle System
- Turn-based combat with real-time elements
- Move animations and effects
- Status effects system
- AI opponent behavior

### 9.4 Research & Progression
- Pokedex research tasks
- Crafting system
- Quest/mission system
- Story progression

---

## PHASE 10: Polish & Content

### 10.1 Content Creation Tools
- Level editor
- Creature editor
- Animation tools
- Asset pipeline

### 10.2 Game Content
- Multiple biomes/areas
- Creature roster implementation
- Story missions and dialogue
- Balancing and tuning

### 10.3 Final Polish
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixing and stability
- Platform-specific features
- Release preparation

---

## Key Design Principles Throughout

### Simple is Powerful
- Each system has clear, focused responsibilities
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Minimize dependencies between systems

### Test as We Go
- Unit tests for each major system
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks at each phase

### Document Often
- Architecture decisions documented
- System interactions clearly defined
- Progress tracked and communicated

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 6.1)

1. **Complete current architecture refactoring**
2. **Design ECS architecture** following our "Simple is Powerful" principle
3. **Implement basic Entity/Component/System framework**
4. **Migrate existing objects (camera, lighting) to ECS**
5. **Test ECS with multiple rendered objects**

This roadmap ensures we build the **engine foundation first**, then layer on **Pokemon-specific features** systematically. Each phase builds upon previous work while keeping our ultimate goal in sight.
